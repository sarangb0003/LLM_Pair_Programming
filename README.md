#  Pair Programming using LLM  
```
Created an app for Pair Programming using LLM model to perform operations like
improve, simplify or debug on existing Python Code.   
```

## Pre-requisites:
- Python
- PaLM API

## Demo:
![streamlit-streamlit_app-2023-09-29-10-09-37](https://github.com/sarangb0003/LLM_Pair_Programming/assets/61322867/70e1afc0-314f-4e57-8c5d-5fdb715bd206)


## Input data used in Demo:
[text_London_information.pdf](https://github.com/sarangb0003/Fine-Tuned-LLM-for-Custom-Data/files/12642305/text_London_information.pdf)
<br>

## Details:
1) Generate Code: It will generate code as per the users requirement. <br>
2) Improve Existing Code: Make changes in exiting code which will be optimal in use. <br>
3) Simplify Code: Note down the steps which will help us to understand the execution flow. <br>
4) Debug your Code: It will help us to find error in existing code. <br>
etc

## Challenges:
--> Hallucination: Sometimes creating unrealistic results. Hence, it may generate false results. <br> 

## Future Work:
--> Fine tune the model for more accurate results and can give answer human like text <br>
